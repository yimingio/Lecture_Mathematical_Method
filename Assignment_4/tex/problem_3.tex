\textbf{Question 3} 

Consider the linear system
$$
\begin{aligned}
4.3 x_{1}+6.6 x_{2}-5.3 x_{3}+6.8 x_{4} &=48.81 \\
2.5 x_{1}-1.2 x_{2}+6.6 x_{3}-2.0 x_{4} &=-30.50 \\
5.4 x_{1}+2.2 x_{2}-2.6 x_{3}+3.5 x_{4} &=45.69 \\
-7.2 x_{1}+5.3 x_{2}-1.3 x_{3}+4.9 x_{4} &=-18.15
\end{aligned}
$$


\textbf a. Solve the system by using the method of Gaussian Elimination. In each arithmetic operation, round to two decimal places.



\textbf b. Solve the system by using the method of Gaussian Elimination with partial pivoting. In each arithmetic operation, round to two decimal places.
